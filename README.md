# Blocsoc Open Projects 2024

The enclosed README contains a list of proposed ideas for this year's BlocSoc Open Projects. Candidates are encouraged to familiarize themselves with these topics and submit a detailed proposal based on their selected idea for evaluation. Those who are selected will have the opportunity to undertake their projects under the guidance of BlocSoc. Successful completion of these projects will result in formal verification by BlocSoc.

## Problem Statements

Here is a list of our 2024 problem statements:

### **DappHack**

- Solve the existing beginner-friendly issues in Blocsoc's [DappHack](https://github.com/blocsoc-iitr/DappHack).
- DappHack is an advance Web3 Hackathon portal.
- Various issue has been raised related to frontend, backend and smart contracts development.
- You are required to choose from the given list of issues and make a proposal on how you would be tackling it.

### **Cross-chain Bridge**
- Candidate is expected here to make a cross-chain bridge, a cross-chain bridge is a protocol which allows user to transfer assets between various blockchains.
- Make a proposal describing the architecture of smart contract and backend for calling these contracts.
- The final outcome of your code should be a fully functioning Cross-Chain-Bridge with a very basic frontend.

### **Undercollaterized lending and borrowing platform**

- Build a DEFI protocol which will allow users to lend and borrow assets on a blockchain.
- The main challenge here is that, most of the existing DEFI protocols are Over-Collaterize i:e the value of collateral deposited is much more than the assets provided. Hence you need to think of a proper solution on your own on how you would keep your protocol undercollaterized, without compromising security and financial risks.
- You are expected to submit a proposal describing your Smart Contract architecture.
- The final outcome of your code should be a fully functioning Undercollaterized DEFI protocol with a very basic frontend, we are mostly intrested in your solution logic and code for that.

### **HorseRiders**

- Come up with an idea for a non-existent library in **huff** to build and merge in Blocsoc's [HorseRiders](https://github.com/blocsoc-iitr/HorseRiders).
- Huff is a low-level assembly language for EVM.
- You are required to develop unique Mathematical or Cryptography libraries in Huff with efficient and highly gas-optimized code.
- For your reference we have already implemented Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) algoritmin in Huff.

## Guidelines

### 1. Research and identify your problem statement

- Review the project description for the existing projects and understand the requirements for the problem statements.
- For the non-existing projects, research about how will you develop the project
- If you have any doubt regarding the problem statements, discuss with the assigned mentors.

### 2. How to prepare your proposal

- Please use the template provided for applying in this program.
- Tell us why you are fit for the problem statement you are choosing and mention your past experiences(if any).
- Tell us how you will solve the problem statement in a detailed manner along with the goals till your mid and final evaluation.
- Add links to the resources you will need for completing the problem statements.
- Also add the follow-up ideas for the problem statements if you have any.

**NOTE**: We don't expect you to be knowing everything about the problem statements, we want you to understand the concepts in it correctly and we will guide you for the same.

### 3. Deliverables

- The final deliverable for the non-existing projects will be a github repo. We will provide for more resources if needed during any phase of the program.

## Contributing

Please find detailed instructions on how to contribute to existing projects and also during this program in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Blocsoc-iitr/open-projects/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
