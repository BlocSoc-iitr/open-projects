# Blocsoc Open Projects 2024

Blocsoc is conducting an event in which you can get a chance to get your hands on blockchain.
You are expected to submit a proposal explaining your idea to solve the provided problem statements.
Â We will contact the selected candidates and then they will proceed to the coding phase!!!

## Problem Statements

Here is a list of our 2024 problem statements:

### **DappHack**

- Solve the existing beginner-friendly issues in Blocsoc's [DappHack](https://github.com/blocsoc-iitr/DappHack).

### **Cross-chain Bridge**

-Create a cross-chain bridge using solidity and websockets to increase Interoperability by enabling token transfers, bi-directional asset transfers etc.

### **Undercollaterized lending and borrowing platform**

- Use solidity to build a DeFi platform where loans can be provided without collaterization and hence create risk assessment techniques like credit scores,reputation systems etc to maintain the platform.

### **HorseRiders**

- Come up with an idea for a non-existent library in **huff** to build and merge in Blocsoc's [HorseRiders](https://github.com/blocsoc-iitr/HorseRiders).

### **Storylok**

- Come up with an idea that uses mesh micro-rollups concept to enhance forking and reduce computational expense for on-chain applications.

## Guidelines

### 1. Research and identify your problem statement

- Review the project description for the existing projects and understand the requirements for the problem statements.
- For the non-existing projects, research about how will you develop the project
- If you have any doubt regarding the problem statements, discuss with the assigned mentors.

### 2. How to prepare your proposal

- Please use the template provided for applying in this program.
- Tell us why you are fit for the problem statement you are choosing and mention your past experiences(if any).
- Tell us how you will solve the problem statement in a detailed manner along with the goals till your mid and final evaluation.
- Add links to the resources you will need for completing the problem statements.
- Also add the follow-up ideas for the problem statements if you have any.

**NOTE**: We don't expect you to be knowing everything about the problem statements, we want you to understand the concepts in it correctly and we will guide you for the same.

### 3. Deliverables

- The final deliverable for the non-existing projects will be a github repo. We will provide for more resources if needed during any phase of the program.
